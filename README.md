# Minesweeper 💣

## Getting started 🏁

You will need to configure the CMAKE file within the project to get started, to do that you will need to connect the following libraries 📚
- GLFW 3.4
- Google Tests
- Eigen
- stb_image
- Openal
- Qt

After that you will just need to run the CMMAKE file and that will initialize all the files within your given IDE.
Afterwards you can hit run code on the main.cpp or hit run on the main.exe file.

## Information 
This is essesenially just a game minesweeper clone that I have made using C++, and plays very similarly to the actual game, except now you can play it offline,
instead of on the minesweeper website or google chromes web game.
